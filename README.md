# AI Mock Interviewer using AI Agent

Your personal AI-powered mock interview assistant, designed to help you prepare confidently for real-world job interviews.

üîó [[Demo Coming Soon]]

This app simulates an actual interview environment by asking role- and round-specific questions. You can speak your answers out loud, get real-time transcription, and receive AI-generated feedback to improve your structure, clarity, and confidence.

---

## ‚òïÔ∏è Project Goals

AI Mock Interviewer was built to address a common problem: students and candidates often skip mock interviews and struggle during real interviews due to lack of preparation. This app helps you:

* Practice in a private, AI-driven environment before real interviews
* Learn to tackle both technical and HR questions effectively
* Receive structured, repeatable feedback
* Build confidence by speaking answers aloud and iterating based on feedback

---

## üí¨ Features

* **Role & Round Type‚ÄìDriven Interviews**: Provide your role and interview round type (e.g., Technical, HR), and the app generates tailored questions using AI, including trending and relevant content.

* **Voice-First Experience**: Speak your answers aloud using your microphone. The app transcribes your speech in real-time using **Whisper** or a similar STT model and responds via audio using **gTTS** or another TTS model.

* **AI Feedback in Real Time**: After each answer, the LLM evaluates your response and gives feedback on clarity, relevance, structure, technical correctness, and overall delivery.

* **Difficulty Modes**: Select **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Advanced** to adjust question complexity according to your preparation level.

* **Streamlit-Powered UI**: Mobile-friendly interface with minimal clicks, smooth interaction between voice input, transcription, and feedback display.

* **Future Enhancements**: Improve prompt generation for questions and feedback summaries, integrate real-time communication using WebRTC, add additional parameters like skills and seniority for personalized questions, and build an analytics dashboard to track progress.
